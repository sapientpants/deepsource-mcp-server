# DeepSource Issues - Fixed

This document tracks the DeepSource issues that have been fixed in the quality-20250514 branch.

## Completed Fixes

### Code Quality Issues

1. ✅ Fixed unused import in `src/__tests__/deepsource-graphql-execution.test.ts` (line 4) - JS-0356
   - Changed `import { DeepSourceClient }` to `import type { DeepSourceClient }` and `import { DeepSourceClient as DeepSourceClientClass }`

2. ✅ Verified class methods with `this` usage - JS-0105
   - Confirmed methods at lines 2328, 2647, and 2717 in `src/deepsource.ts` either use `this` or are correctly defined as static

3. ✅ Fixed missing JSDoc comment in `src/deepsource.ts` (line 2302) - JS-D1001
   - Added proper JSDoc comment for the method

### Test Coverage Improvements

4. ✅ Added test coverage for report-related utility methods - TCV-001
   - Created comprehensive tests for `extractReportData` method
   - Created comprehensive tests for `getReportField` method
   - Created comprehensive tests for `getTitleForReportType` method
   - Tests are located in `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`

5. ✅ Added test coverage for historical data processing - TCV-001
   - Created tests for `processHistoricalData` method in `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`
   - Tests cover edge cases and error handling

6. ✅ Added test coverage for metric history response creation - TCV-001
   - Created comprehensive tests for `createMetricHistoryResponse` method
   - Tests are located in `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts`
   - Includes tests for increasing, decreasing and stable trends
   - Includes tests for edge cases (empty arrays, missing values)

7. ✅ Added basic tests for metric validation - TCV-001
   - Created tests for metric validation functions in `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`
   - Tests verify proper validation of metric values

8. ✅ Added enum tests for metric threshold functionality - TCV-001
   - Created basic tests in `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts`
   - Tests verify the enum values for MetricShortcode and MetricKey

## Results

1. ✅ All tests passing (259 tests)
2. ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
3. ✅ ESLint validation passes
4. ✅ Pull request created: #61
5. ✅ Code coverage improved from ~87.5% to ~89.5% at the statement level
