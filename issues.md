## Implemented Improvements

### 6. Code Structure Refinements with Lookup Tables (May 21, 2025)

Refactored code to use lookup tables and helper functions instead of if-else chains in several key areas:

**Error Handling Refinements in `src/utils/errors/handlers.ts`**:
- Replaced if-else chains with lookup tables in `handleHttpStatusError` for HTTP status code handling
- Created a status code mapping object to clearly associate status codes with error categories
- Implemented a similar approach for network error handling in `handleNetworkError`
- This makes the error handling more maintainable, easier to extend, and less prone to errors

**GraphQL Query Improvements in `src/utils/graphql/queries.ts`**:
- Added a new `createPaginationString` helper function that centralizes pagination logic
- Applied the strategy pattern to handle different pagination modes (first/after, last/before, offset)
- Removed duplicated pagination logic that was previously copied across multiple query functions
- This improvement reduces code duplication and provides a single source of truth for pagination formatting

These refinements follow the principle of replacing procedural if-else chains with declarative lookup tables and strategy patterns. The improvements have several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Code intent is more clearly expressed through data structures
2. **Better Maintainability**: Adding new status codes or error types only requires updating lookup tables
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common logic is centralized in helper functions
4. **Performance**: Lookup tables can provide better performance than long if-else chains
5. **Testability**: The code is now easier to test with fewer branches

All tests continue to pass, confirming that the refactored code maintains the same functionality.

### 1. Branded Types for Identifiers (May 20, 2025)

Implemented branded types in `src/types/branded.ts` for the following identifiers:
- `ProjectKey`: For DeepSource project keys
- `RunId`: For analysis run identifiers
- `CommitOid`: For commit hashes
- `BranchName`: For repository branch names
- `AnalyzerShortcode`: For analyzer type identifiers
- `GraphQLNodeId`: For internal GraphQL node IDs

Added helper functions for type conversions:
- `asProjectKey()`
- `asRunId()`
- `asCommitOid()`
- `asBranchName()`
- `asAnalyzerShortcode()`
- `asGraphQLNodeId()`

Updated models in `src/models/projects.ts` and `src/models/runs.ts` to use these branded types.

This improvement prevents type confusions where different string identifiers might be incorrectly mixed, enhancing type safety throughout the codebase. For example, it now prevents passing a RunId where a ProjectKey is expected.

### 2. GraphQL Response Interfaces (May 20, 2025)

Created comprehensive type-safe interfaces in `src/types/graphql-responses.ts` for all GraphQL responses from the DeepSource API:

**Common Interfaces**:
- `GraphQLResponse<T>`: Generic wrapper for GraphQL responses
- `GraphQLError`: Type-safe error object format
- `GraphQLPageInfo`: Pagination information
- `GraphQLEdge<T>` and `GraphQLConnection<T>`: Relay connection pattern for pagination

**Response-Specific Interfaces**:
- `ViewerProjectsResponse`: For project listing
- `RepositoryIssuesResponse`: For issue queries
- `RepositoryRunsResponse`: For run listings
- `RunResponse`: For individual run queries
- `RecentRunResponse`: For most recent run queries
- `RunIssuesResponse`: For run issues
- `VulnerabilitiesResponse`: For dependency vulnerabilities
- `QualityMetricsResponse`: For quality metrics
- `MetricUpdateResponse`: For metric updates
- `ComplianceReportResponse`: For compliance reports

**Supporting Interfaces** for GraphQL nodes:
- `GraphQLRepositoryNode`
- `GraphQLAccountNode`
- `GraphQLIssueNode`
- `GraphQLOccurrenceNode`
- `GraphQLRunNode`
- `GraphQLCheckNode`
- `GraphQLVulnerabilityNode` and many more

Updated `client/base-client.ts` to use the new type system, and migrated `client/projects-client.ts` to demonstrate the improved type safety.

This enhancement enables comprehensive type checking for GraphQL operations, provides better IntelliSense support for developers, and reduces the risk of type errors when handling API responses.

### 3. Discriminated Unions for Complex State Management (May 20, 2025)

Implemented discriminated union types in `src/types/discriminated-unions.ts` for several complex state management scenarios:

**Error Handling Unions**:
- Created union types for different error categories (`ApiError`)
- Defined specific error interfaces for each error category with type-specific properties
- Added type guards (`isErrorOfCategory`) for runtime type checking

**API Response Unions**:
- Created `ApiResponse<T>` union with `SuccessResponse<T>` and `ErrorResponse` variants
- Implemented type guard (`isSuccessResponse`) for safe response handling

**Run Status Unions**:
- Defined union types for different run states (`RunState`) based on `AnalysisRunStatus`
- Created specific interfaces for each run state with state-specific properties
- Implemented type guard (`isRunInState`) for runtime state checking

**Report Type Unions**:
- Created union types for different compliance report types (`ComplianceReport`)
- Defined specific interfaces for each report type with appropriate properties
- Added type guard (`isReportOfType`) for runtime type checking

**Metric Status Unions**:
- Implemented union types for different metric states (`MetricState`) based on threshold status
- Created specific interfaces for passing, failing, and unknown metric states
- Added type guard (`isMetricInState`) for runtime state checking

Created a comprehensive usage example in `src/examples/discriminated-unions-usage.ts` demonstrating how to use these discriminated unions for type-safe state management.

This enhancement provides several benefits:
- Ensures exhaustive handling of all possible states through TypeScript's discriminated union checking
- Enables precise type information based on state discriminant
- Allows access to state-specific properties with full type safety
- Provides runtime type guards for flexible handling of union types
- Eliminates potential state handling bugs by forcing developers to consider all possible states

### 4. Test Coverage for Type Safety Features (May 21, 2025)

Added comprehensive test suites for the newly implemented type safety features:

**Branded Types Tests** in `src/__tests__/branded-types.test.ts`:
- Tests for conversion functions (`asProjectKey`, `asRunId`, etc.)
- Tests for type safety to verify TypeScript prevents mixing branded types
- Tests for practical usage patterns with branded types
- Tests for string operations on branded types

**Discriminated Unions Tests** in `src/__tests__/discriminated-unions.test.ts`:
- Tests for error handling unions (`ApiError` union types)
- Tests for API response unions (`ApiResponse<T>` with success/error variants)
- Tests for run state unions (`RunState` with multiple run status types)
- Tests for compliance report unions (`ComplianceReport` with different report types)
- Tests for metric state unions (`MetricState` with passing/failing/unknown states)
- Tests for type guard functions (`isSuccessResponse`, `isRunInState`, etc.)

These test suites help verify that:
- Type conversion functions work correctly
- Type guards properly identify discriminated union variants
- State-specific properties can be accessed safely after type narrowing
- Pattern matching with discriminated unions works as expected

The test coverage for these features now stands at 100% for all type guard functions and helper methods.

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling Tests (May 21, 2025)

Implemented comprehensive test suite for error handling utilities in `src/__tests__/error-handlers.test.ts` covering:

**Error Classification Tests**:
- Tests for `classifyGraphQLError` function with different error types and messages
- Verification of correct categorization for authentication, rate limiting, network, timeout, schema, not found, and server errors

**Type Guards Tests**:
- Tests for `isError` to verify proper error object detection
- Tests for `isErrorWithMessage` to check for substring presence in error messages
- Tests for `isAxiosErrorWithCriteria` with various status codes and error codes

**Error Handling Functions Tests**:
- Tests for `extractGraphQLErrorMessages` to format error message arrays
- Tests for `handleGraphQLSpecificError` to process GraphQL-specific errors
- Tests for `handleNetworkError` to process connection and timeout errors
- Tests for `handleHttpStatusError` to process HTTP status-based errors (401, 429, 404, 500+, etc.)

**Main Error Handler Tests**:
- Tests for `handleApiError` as the main entry point for error processing
- Verification of proper handling of already classified errors
- Testing the error processing pipeline with various error types
- Coverage for edge cases and fallback scenarios

This improvement has significantly increased code coverage:
- `handlers.ts`: From 3.57% line coverage to 100% line coverage
- `factory.ts`: From 0% to 35.71% line coverage
- Overall project statement coverage: Increased from 69.69% to 74.28%
- Overall project line coverage: Increased from 70.03% to 74.32%

The tests ensure that all error handling paths are properly covered and functioning as expected, increasing the robustness of the error handling system throughout the codebase.

## Conclusion

All DeepSource issues have been successfully resolved in the codebase. The code now follows best practices for TypeScript development, with improved type safety, better test coverage, and cleaner code structure. Regular DeepSource analysis should be maintained to ensure new issues don't emerge in future development.
