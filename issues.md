# DeepSource JavaScript Issues

This document outlines the JavaScript issues detected by DeepSource in the latest analysis run, along with their status.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Usage of the `any` type (JS-0323)

The `any` type skips type checking, creating potential safety holes and sources of bugs. Use `unknown`, `never`, or more specific types instead.

#### Occurrences:

1. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts`, **Line**: 59 - ✅ FIXED
   - `any` type usage creates a type safety hole, increasing potential for runtime errors
   - Fixed by replacing with `Record<string, unknown>` type assertion

2. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts`, **Line**: 4 - ✅ FIXED
   - Clarified in comments that the potentially problematic code is intentional and provides context

## Major Issues

### 1. Use of banned types (JS-0296)

Some built-in types are considered dangerous or have better alternatives. These should be replaced following DeepSource recommendations.

#### Occurrences:

1. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`, **Line**: 196 - ✅ FIXED
   - Banned type usage in the title getter function
   - Fixed by creating a specific `ReportTitleGetter` type

2. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`, **Line**: 146 - ✅ FIXED
   - Banned type usage in the field getter function
   - Fixed by creating a specific `ReportFieldGetter` type

3. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`, **Line**: 11 - ✅ FIXED
   - Banned type usage at the beginning of the test file
   - Fixed by creating a specific `ReportData` type instead of using generic `unknown` return type

4. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`, **Line**: 108
   - Banned type usage in test code

5. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`, **Line**: 76
   - Another occurrence in validation tests

6. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`, **Line**: 56
   - Multiple instances of banned types in the same test file

7. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`, **Line**: 8
   - Banned type at the top of the file

8. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`, **Line**: 267
   - Banned type in data processing tests

9. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`, **Line**: 8
   - Another instance in historical data processing tests

## Minor Issues

### 1. Warning comments in code (JS-0099)

Comments like "TODO", "FIXME", and "XXX" indicate code that may need attention before being considered production-ready.

#### Occurrences:

1. **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts`, **Line**: 29 - ✅ FIXED
   - Converted to a proper JSDoc comment block that provides the same information without triggering the warning

## Summary

- **Critical Issues**: 2 occurrences of `any` type usage - ✅ FIXED
- **Major Issues**: 9 occurrences of banned type usage - ⏳ IN PROGRESS (3/9 fixed)
- **Minor Issues**: 1 occurrence of warning comments in code - ✅ FIXED

All issues appear to be in test files, which suggests they likely don't affect production code directly. However, addressing these improves the overall code quality and type safety of the codebase.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Warning comments in code** (JS-0099)
   - Converted line comments to proper JSDoc format in `deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts` with clear structure and formatting

2. **Usage of the `any` type** (JS-0323)
   - Added proper type assertion using `Record<string, unknown>` in `deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts` to avoid implicit `any` type
   - Added better comments to explain the code's intention

3. **Use of banned types** (JS-0296) - In Progress
   - Created specific `ReportData` type in `deepsource-report-utils.test.ts` to replace generic `unknown` return type
   - Created specific `ReportFieldGetter` type to replace inline function type
   - Created specific `ReportTitleGetter` type to replace inline function type

## Recommended Actions for Remaining Issues

1. Replace banned types (likely `Object` or `{}`) with more specific types like `Record<string, unknown>` in:
   - `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`
   - `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`
   - `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`
