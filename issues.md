# DeepSource JavaScript Issues Todo List

This file contains all current JavaScript issues detected by DeepSource on the fix-quality-issues branch.

## Summary
- **Total Issues**: 12 
- **Critical**: 2
- **Major**: 9
- **Minor**: 1
- **All issues are in test files**

## Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### JS-0323: Detected usage of the `any` type
The TypeScript compiler doesn't perform any type-checking for variables typed as `any`, which can hide potential issues and bugs.

#### Todo:
- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts` - Line 4
  - Replace `any` type with appropriate TypeScript type (likely `unknown` or a specific interface)
  
- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts` - Line 59
  - Replace `any` type with appropriate TypeScript type (likely `unknown` or a specific interface)

## Major Issues (Priority 2)

### JS-0296: Use of a banned type detected
Usage of banned types like `Object`, `{}`, `object`, and upper-case primitives (`String`, `Number`, etc.) reduces type safety.

#### Todo:

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`**
- [ ] Line 11: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 146: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 196: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`**
- [ ] Line 8: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 56: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 76: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 108: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`**
- [ ] Line 8: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type
- [ ] Line 267: Replace banned type with proper TypeScript type

## Minor Issues (Priority 3)

### JS-0099: Found warning comments in code
TODO/FIXME/XXX comments indicate incomplete work or known issues that should be addressed.

#### Todo:
- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts` - Line 29
  - Address the TODO comment and implement the missing functionality or remove the comment if no longer needed

## Recommended Fixes

### For JS-0323 (any type):
1. Replace `any` with `unknown` when the type is truly unknown
2. Use proper interfaces or types when the structure is known
3. Use type guards to narrow down `unknown` types when needed

### For JS-0296 (banned types):
1. Replace `Object` with `Record<string, unknown>` for generic object types
2. Replace `{}` with `Record<string, never>` for empty objects
3. Replace upper-case primitives (`String`, `Number`, etc.) with lowercase equivalents (`string`, `number`, etc.)
4. Use specific interfaces when the object structure is known

### For JS-0099 (warning comments):
1. Review the TODO comment to understand what needs to be done
2. Either implement the missing functionality or remove the comment if obsolete
3. If the TODO is for future work, consider creating a GitHub issue instead

## Notes
- All current issues are in test files only - production code is clean
- The last DeepSource run introduced 39 issues (38 ANTI_PATTERN, 1 DOCUMENTATION), but many have been fixed
- Current issues represent the remaining work to achieve full DeepSource compliance

## Next Steps
1. Fix all Critical issues first (JS-0323)
2. Address Major issues (JS-0296) 
3. Clean up Minor issues (JS-0099)
4. Run DeepSource analysis again to confirm all issues are resolved
