## Lessons Learned (So Far)

### What Worked Well

1. **Factory Pattern**: The `createBaseHandlerFactory` provided an elegant solution for:
   - Consistent error handling
   - Automatic logging
   - Dependency injection
   - Response formatting

2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with `HandlerFunction` and `HandlerFactory` types caught issues early

3. **Centralized Tool Definitions**: Having all Zod schemas in one place improves maintainability

### Challenges Encountered

1. **MCP Type Compatibility**: The MCP server has specific type requirements that needed careful handling:
   - Required `Record<string, unknown>` for handler parameters
   - Response format must include `content` array
   - Had to create custom `McpResponse` type for proper typing

2. **ESLint Configuration**: Some patterns (like factory functions) triggered unused variable warnings that needed suppression

3. **Test Coverage**: New infrastructure components (tool-registry, tool-definitions) need comprehensive tests

### Recommendations for Next Phase

1. **Handler Refactoring**: Use the established pattern consistently:
   ```typescript
   export const createXHandler = createBaseHandlerFactory('handler_name', async (deps, params) => {
     // Implementation
   });
   ```

2. **Test First**: Write tests for new components before implementation

3. **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each handler refactoring to maintain a clean history

4. **Type Assertions**: Be careful with type assertions - prefer proper typing over `as unknown as Type`

## Quick Reference for Continuing the Refactoring

### Handler Refactoring Template
```typescript
// 1. Import dependencies
import { BaseHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.interface.js';
import { createBaseHandlerFactory, wrapInApiResponse, createDefaultHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.factory.js';
import { createLogger } from '../utils/logging/logger.js';

// 2. Create logger
const logger = createLogger('HandlerName');

// 3. Create handler with factory
export const createHandlerName = createBaseHandlerFactory(
  'tool_name',
  async (deps, params: ParamsType) => {
    const apiKey = deps.getApiKey();
    const client = new DeepSourceClient(apiKey);
    
    // Handler logic here
    const result = await client.someMethod(params);
    
    // Format response
    return wrapInApiResponse(result);
  }
);

// 4. Export public function
export async function handleHandlerName(params: ParamsType) {
  const deps = createDefaultHandlerDeps({ logger });
  const handler = createHandlerName(deps);
  return handler(params);
}
```

### Checklist for Each Handler
- [ ] Remove direct `process.env` access
- [ ] Add dependency injection via factory pattern
- [ ] Use `wrapInApiResponse` for consistent formatting
- [ ] Add proper logging with handler-specific logger
- [ ] Update imports to use base handler utilities

   - Provides default values for optional fields

5. **QualityMetricsRepository Implementation**
   - Concrete implementation of `IQualityMetricsRepository` using `DeepSourceClient`
   - Maps one API metric to multiple domain aggregates (one per item/language)
   - Supports composite ID format: `projectKey:metricKey:shortcode`
   - Implements save operations via threshold and setting updates
   - Handles failing/reported metrics filtering with proper business logic

6. **QualityMetricsMapper Implementation**
   - Maps between DeepSource API metrics and domain QualityMetrics aggregates

2. **Full Mapper Coverage**: All domain aggregates have corresponding mappers
3. **Fresh Data Guarantee**: No caching implemented, ensuring data freshness
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All repositories handle API errors gracefully
5. **TypeScript Safety**: Strong typing throughout with branded types
6. **Test Coverage**: 90.92% overall coverage with infrastructure layer fully tested
7. **Dependency Injection**: Repository factory provides clean DI pattern

### Repository Factory Details

The repository factory implementation provides a centralized way to create repository instances with their required dependencies:

- **Configuration Management**: Accepts API key and optional base URL
- **Instance Caching**: Avoids creating multiple instances for performance
- **Individual Creation Methods**: Allows creating specific repositories when needed
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Convenience Functions**: `createRepositoryFactory()` and `createRepositories()` for easy usage

### Next Infrastructure Tasks

1. Update handlers to use domain aggregates via repositories
2. Refactor DeepSourceClient into domain-specific clients  
3. Integrate repository factory with main MCP server

## Phase 3 Infrastructure Layer Complete Summary

The infrastructure layer implementation is now fully complete, providing a solid foundation for the domain-driven design architecture.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Repository Implementations (Days 7-9)**
   - Created concrete implementations for all 4 domain repositories
   - Each repository ensures fresh data retrieval from DeepSource API (no caching)
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging throughout
   - Added support for all repository interface methods

2. **Mapper Implementations**
   - Created mappers for all domain aggregates (Project, AnalysisRun, QualityMetrics, ComplianceReport)
   - Handles complex transformations between API models and domain aggregates
   - Manages edge cases like missing data and type conversions
   - Special handling for QualityMetrics one-to-many mapping

3. **Repository Factory Pattern**
   - Centralized dependency injection for all repositories
   - Instance caching to improve performance
   - Configuration management with defensive copying
   - Individual repository creation methods for flexibility

4. **Test Coverage Achievements**
   - 163 new infrastructure tests added
   - Total test count: 1397 (up from 1234)
   - Overall coverage: 90.92%
   - Infrastructure layer has near 100% test coverage

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **No Caching Policy**: All repositories fetch fresh data on every request to ensure data accuracy
2. **Read-Only Operations**: Most repositories are read-only, with save/delete throwing informative errors
3. **Composite Keys**: QualityMetrics uses composite IDs (projectKey:metricKey:shortcode)
4. **Error Propagation**: Repository errors are properly classified and propagated with context
5. **TypeScript Safety**: Extensive use of branded types and strong typing throughout

### Ready for Next Phase

The infrastructure layer provides everything needed for the next phase:
- Domain aggregates can be retrieved via repositories
- API data is properly transformed to domain models
- Dependency injection is ready via the factory
- All components are thoroughly tested

The foundation is now solid for integrating the domain layer with the existing handlers.

## Phase 4 Handler Integration Beginning

### Projects Handler Domain Integration (Day 10)

Successfully migrated the projects handler from direct client usage to domain
aggregates via repositories:

#### Changes Made

1. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Replaced `DeepSourceClientFactory` with `RepositoryFactory`
   - Changed from `ProjectsClient` to `IProjectRepository`
   - Simplified dependency injection interface

2. **Handler Implementation**:
   - Removed API key retrieval logic (handled by repository)
   - Updated to use `projectRepository.findAll()` instead of client calls
   - Maintained same response format for MCP compatibility

3. **Test Updates**:
   - Replaced client mocks with repository mocks
   - Updated test expectations to match repository-based flow
   - All 7 tests passing with domain integration

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Cleaner Architecture**: Handler now works with domain concepts
- **Better Separation**: Business logic separated from API details
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with domain aggregates
- **Fresh Data**: Repository ensures data freshness from DeepSource API
- **Testability**: Easier to mock and test with repository pattern

#### Code Structure

```typescript
// Old approach - direct client usage
const projectsClient = deps.clientFactory.getProjectsClient();
const projects = await projectsClient.listProjects();

// New approach - domain repository
const projects = await deps.projectRepository.findAll();
```

The projects handler now serves as the template for migrating other handlers to use domain aggregates.

## Phase 5 Client Architecture Redesign & Repository Factory Integration

### Domain-Specific Client Implementation (Day 11)

Successfully created domain-specific clients to replace the monolithic DeepSourceClient:

#### New Client Architecture

1. **BaseDeepSourceClient**:
   - Common functionality for all clients
   - GraphQL query execution and response handling
   - Error handling and logging
   - Shared utilities (findProjectByKey, normalizePaginationParams)

2. **Domain-Specific Clients**:
   - **IssuesClient**: Issue and vulnerability operations
   - **RunsClient**: Analysis run operations and queries
   - **MetricsClient**: Quality metrics management
   - **SecurityClient**: Security compliance and vulnerabilities

3. **DeepSourceClientFactory Updates**:
   - Now creates and manages domain-specific clients
   - Singleton pattern for efficiency
   - Maintains backward compatibility

#### Key Implementation Details

- Extended BaseDeepSourceClient with shared utility methods
- Each client focuses on its domain responsibilities
- Fresh data retrieval maintained (no caching)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Type-safe with branded types throughout

### Repository Factory Integration (Day 12)

Successfully integrated the repository factory with the MCP server using type adapters:

#### Type Adapter Layer

Created adapters to bridge between MCP tool schemas (primitive types) and domain handlers (branded types):

1. **Adapter Functions**:
   - Convert primitive strings to branded types
   - Handle optional parameters gracefully
   - Maintain type safety throughout
   - Support both current handlers and future domain handlers

2. **Registry Implementation**:
   - Created `index-registry.ts` as alternative implementation
   - Uses ToolRegistry with domain architecture
   - Integrates adapters for type compatibility
   - Maintains backward compatibility

#### Integration Approach

```typescript
// Adapter example
export function adaptQualityMetricsParams(params: any): DeepsourceQualityMetricsParams {
  return {
    projectKey: params.projectKey, // Handler expects string
    shortcodeIn: params.shortcodeIn as MetricShortcode[] | undefined,
  };
}

// Registry integration
toolRegistry.registerTool({
  ...qualityMetricsToolSchema,
  handler: async (params: Record<string, unknown>) => {
    const adaptedParams = adaptQualityMetricsParams(params);
    return handleDeepsourceQualityMetrics(adaptedParams);
  },
});
```

#### Test Coverage Achievements

- Created comprehensive adapter tests (23 tests, 100% coverage)
- Integration tests for registry implementation (11 tests)
- All existing tests continue to pass (1455 total)

#### Integration Benefits

1. **Clean Architecture**: Repository pattern fully integrated
2. **Type Safety**: Adapters ensure type compatibility
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch between implementations
4. **Future-Ready**: Easy to migrate to full domain handlers
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API preserved
