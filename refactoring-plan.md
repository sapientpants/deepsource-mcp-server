## 1. Handler Architecture Refactoring

### Current Issues:
- ~~Inconsistent handler patterns (some use dependency injection, others don't)~~ âœ… Partially resolved
- ~~Direct environment variable access in handlers~~ âœ… Partially resolved
- Mixed responsibilities between MCP tool registration and business logic
- ~~Repetitive error handling and response formatting~~ âœ… Partially resolved

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 1.1 Standardize Handler Pattern âœ… In Progress
- ~~Create a unified handler factory pattern for all handlers~~ âœ… Done
- Move all business logic out of the main index.ts file
- ~~Implement consistent dependency injection across all handlers~~ âœ… Partially done

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `BaseHandlerDeps` interface for common dependencies
- Implemented `createBaseHandlerFactory` for consistent handler creation
- Added `HandlerFunction` and `HandlerFactory` types for type safety
- Handlers now receive dependencies via factory pattern instead of direct env access

**All Handlers Successfully Refactored:**
- [x] quality-metrics.ts
- [x] compliance-reports.ts
- [x] project-issues.ts
- [x] project-runs.ts
- [x] run.ts
- [x] recent-run-issues.ts
- [x] dependency-vulnerabilities.ts

#### 1.2 Handler Middleware System âœ… Partially Implemented
- ~~Implement a middleware pipeline for cross-cutting concerns:~~ âœ… Basic implementation done
  - ~~Request validation~~ âœ… Via Zod in ToolRegistry
  - ~~Error handling and classification~~ âœ… In createBaseHandlerFactory
  - ~~Response formatting~~ âœ… Via wrapInApiResponse
  - ~~Logging and metrics~~ âœ… In createBaseHandlerFactory

**Implementation Details:**
- Error handling centralized in `createBaseHandlerFactory`
- Logging automatically captures handler invocation, success, and errors
- Response formatting handled by `wrapInApiResponse` helper

#### 1.3 Tool Registration Abstraction âœ… Done
- ~~Create a ToolRegistry class to manage tool definitions~~ âœ… Done
- ~~Separate tool schema definitions from handler logic~~ âœ… Done
- ~~Implement automatic tool discovery and registration~~ âœ… Done

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `ToolRegistry` class with type-safe tool registration
- Tool definitions centralized in `tool-definitions.ts`
- Registry handles MCP server registration, validation, and response formatting
- Supports both Zod input/output validation and automatic error handling

## 2. Domain Modeling Improvements

### Current Issues:
- Loose domain boundaries between different concerns
- Missing aggregate roots for complex entities
- Insufficient use of branded types throughout the codebase

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 2.1 Domain Aggregate Design âœ… Complete
- Create proper aggregates for:
  - âœ… Project (root: includes repository info, configuration)
  - âœ… AnalysisRun (root: includes issues, summaries)
  - âœ… QualityMetrics (root: includes thresholds, history)
  - âœ… ComplianceReport (root: includes stats, trends)

**Implementation Details (Days 3-4):**
- Created complete domain layer structure under `src/domain/`
- Implemented base building blocks:
  - `ValueObject`: Base class for immutable value objects with deep equality
  - `Entity`: Base class with unique identity
  - `AggregateRoot`: Base class with domain event support
  - `IRepository`: Repository pattern interface with pagination
- Created value objects:
  - `ThresholdValue`: Metric thresholds with validation and evaluation
  - `MetricValue`: Metric measurements with units and change calculations
  - `IssueCount`: Non-negative integer counts with arithmetic operations
  - `CoveragePercentage`: Specialized coverage metrics with level categorization
- Implemented all aggregates:
  - `Project`: Complete with status management and domain events
  - `AnalysisRun`: With state transitions and issue tracking
  - `QualityMetrics`: With threshold evaluation and trend analysis
  - `ComplianceReport`: With severity distribution and compliance scoring
- Created comprehensive implementation summary documentation
- All code passes linting, type checking, and CI pipeline (1076 tests, 79.15% coverage)

#### 2.2 Repository Pattern Implementation
- Create repository interfaces for each aggregate
- Implement caching strategies at the repository level
- Separate read and write operations (CQRS-lite)

#### 2.3 Enhanced Type Safety
- Extend branded types usage to all identifiers
- Create value objects for complex values (e.g., ThresholdValue, MetricValue)
- Implement discriminated unions for all status/state fields

## 3. Client Architecture Redesign

### Current Issues:

- Improved developer experience with clear abstractions

## Lessons Learned (So Far)

### What Worked Well
1. **Factory Pattern**: The `createBaseHandlerFactory` provided an elegant solution for:
   - Consistent error handling
   - Automatic logging
   - Dependency injection
   - Response formatting

2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with `HandlerFunction` and `HandlerFactory` types caught issues early

3. **Centralized Tool Definitions**: Having all Zod schemas in one place improves maintainability

### Challenges Encountered
1. **MCP Type Compatibility**: The MCP server has specific type requirements that needed careful handling:
   - Required `Record<string, unknown>` for handler parameters
   - Response format must include `content` array
   - Had to create custom `McpResponse` type for proper typing

2. **ESLint Configuration**: Some patterns (like factory functions) triggered unused variable warnings that needed suppression

3. **Test Coverage**: New infrastructure components (tool-registry, tool-definitions) need comprehensive tests

### Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Handler Refactoring**: Use the established pattern consistently:
   ```typescript
   export const createXHandler = createBaseHandlerFactory('handler_name', async (deps, params) => {
     // Implementation
   });
   ```

2. **Test First**: Write tests for new components before implementation

3. **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each handler refactoring to maintain a clean history

4. **Type Assertions**: Be careful with type assertions - prefer proper typing over `as unknown as Type`

## Quick Reference for Continuing the Refactoring

### Handler Refactoring Template
```typescript
// 1. Import dependencies
import { BaseHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.interface.js';
import { createBaseHandlerFactory, wrapInApiResponse, createDefaultHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.factory.js';
import { createLogger } from '../utils/logging/logger.js';

// 2. Create logger
const logger = createLogger('HandlerName');

// 3. Create handler with factory
export const createHandlerName = createBaseHandlerFactory(
  'tool_name',
  async (deps, params: ParamsType) => {
    const apiKey = deps.getApiKey();
    const client = new DeepSourceClient(apiKey);
    
    // Handler logic here
    const result = await client.someMethod(params);
    
    // Format response
    return wrapInApiResponse(result);
  }
);

// 4. Export public function
export async function handleHandlerName(params: ParamsType) {
  const deps = createDefaultHandlerDeps({ logger });
  const handler = createHandlerName(deps);
  return handler(params);
}
```

### Checklist for Each Handler
- [ ] Remove direct `process.env` access
- [ ] Add dependency injection via factory pattern
- [ ] Use `wrapInApiResponse` for consistent formatting
- [ ] Add proper logging with handler-specific logger
- [ ] Update imports to use base handler utilities
- [ ] Ensure all tests still pass
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Run linter and fix any issues
