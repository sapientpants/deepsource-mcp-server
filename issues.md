# DeepSource Issues

## Type Safety Issues

### JS-0323: Detected usage of the `any` type (CRITICAL)

The `any` type creates a potential safety hole and source of bugs. Replace with `unknown` or `never` type.

1. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:59**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace `any` type with a more specific type~~
   - ~~TypeScript skips type checking for `any` typed variables~~
   - ~~Use `unknown` or `never` instead~~

2. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:4**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace `any` type with a more specific type~~
   - ~~TypeScript skips type checking for `any` typed variables~~

2. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts:146**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~

4. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts:108**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
