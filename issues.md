# DeepSource JavaScript Issues

This document tracks active JavaScript issues from the latest DeepSource run on the `fix-quality-issues` branch.

## Summary

- **Total Issues Found**: 12
- **Critical Issues**: 2
- **Major Issues**: 9  
- **Minor Issues**: 1

## Issue Breakdown

### 1. Detected usage of the `any` type (JS-0323) - CRITICAL

The `any` type disables TypeScript's type checking, which can lead to runtime errors and makes code harder to maintain. Use more specific types or `unknown` instead.

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts`**
- Line 59: Usage of `any` type detected
- Line 4: Usage of `any` type detected

### 2. Found warning comments in code (JS-0099) - MINOR

Warning comments like TODO, FIXME, or HACK indicate incomplete code that needs attention.

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts`**
- Line 29: Warning comment found

### 3. Use of a banned type detected (JS-0296) - MAJOR

Certain types are banned to maintain code consistency and type safety (e.g., `Function`, `Object`, `{}`, `object`).

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts`**
- Line 196: Banned type usage
- Line 146: Banned type usage
- Line 11: Banned type usage

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts`**
- Line 108: Banned type usage
- Line 76: Banned type usage
- Line 56: Banned type usage
- Line 8: Banned type usage

**File: `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts`**
- Line 267: Banned type usage
- Line 8: Banned type usage

## Resolution Priority

1. **Critical (JS-0323)**: Fix `any` type usage - These should be addressed first as they compromise type safety
2. **Major (JS-0296)**: Replace banned types - Use more specific type definitions
3. **Minor (JS-0099)**: Address warning comments - Convert TODO comments to proper documentation or implement the missing functionality

## Notes

All issues are in test files (`__tests__` directory), which is good news as they don't affect production code. However, fixing these will improve test quality and maintainability.
