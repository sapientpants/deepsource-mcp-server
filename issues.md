# DeepSource Issues Todo List

## Code Coverage - TCV-001 (Lines not covered in tests)

DeepSource has identified multiple lines in the codebase that are not covered by tests. Each line is flagged as CRITICAL severity.

### What is TCV-001?
A source line is considered covered when at least one instruction assigned to this line has been executed by a test case. These lines were not executed during any of the test cases.

## Priority Test Plan

1. **Highest Priority (Target: 1 week)** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Add tests for GraphQL module (processor.ts, queries.ts)
   - ✅ Test pagination functionality (helpers.ts)
   - ✅ Test base client functionality (base-client.ts)
   - ✅ Add tests for logging functionality (logger.ts)

2. **High Priority (Target: 2 weeks)** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Test models
   - ✅ Test handlers
   - ✅ Improve error factory test coverage

3. **Medium Priority (Target: 3 weeks)** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Address remaining gaps in well-tested files
   - ✅ Improve branch coverage across the codebase (improved from ~64% to ~79.5%)
   - ✅ Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Address previously untested files:
     - ✅ src/utils/errors/types.ts: Now 100% covered
     - ✅ src/index.new.ts: Now 66.66% line coverage
     - ✅ src/examples/discriminated-unions-usage.ts: Now 71.21% line coverage

## Implementation Strategy

1. **For each untested file:**
   - Review the file's purpose and functionality
   - Identify the key components and code paths
   - Create test fixtures and mocks as needed
   - Write tests that cover the main functionality
   - Add edge case tests for error conditions
   - Verify coverage with `pnpm run test:coverage`

2. **For files with partial coverage:**
   - Run coverage with `--covereage-reporter=html` for visual coverage gaps
   - Focus on untested branches and functions
   - Add targeted tests for specific uncovered lines

3. **Overall approach:**
   - Start with unit tests for individual functions
   - Add integration tests for components working together
   - Create end-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Use mocks and fixtures to isolate tests
   - Ensure tests are maintainable and focused
