## Current Active Issues

### 1. JS-0016: Function declarations in nested blocks
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Category:** BUG_RISK  
**File:** src/__tests__/deepsource-vulnerability-processing.test.ts (multiple occurrences, originally line 445)

✅ **RESOLVED**

Function declarations (with the `function` keyword) and variable declarations should preferably be in the root of a program or the body of a function. Having nested function declarations inside blocks may have unexpected results at runtime due to hoisting.

**Completed fixes:**
- [x] Converted all nested function declarations to function expressions
- [x] Fixed 5 instances of nested generator function declarations:
  - `maxIterationsTestFunction` (line 445)
  - `testGenerator` (line 236)
  - `testNonArrayFunction` (line 412)
  - `errorHandlingTestFunction` (line 496)
  - `nullSkippingTestFunction` (line 537)

### 2. JS-0323: Using the `any` type (24 issues)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** ANTI_PATTERN  
**Affected Files:**
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-vulnerability-processing.test.ts (lines 372, 374)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts (lines 16, 129)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-internal-utils.test.ts (lines 505, 506, 507)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts (lines 15, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 40, 108, 115, 130, 249, 390)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-history.test.ts (line 783)

✅ **RESOLVED**

The `any` type can leak into your codebase. TypeScript compiler skips type checking of `any` typed variables, creating a potential safety hole and source of bugs.

**Completed fixes:**
- [x] Replaced all `any` types with more specific types in 5 identified test files
- [x] Used `unknown` when the type is truly unknown
- [x] Used `Record<string, unknown>` for objects with unknown structure
- [x] Created proper type interfaces for test data
- [x] Used generic types where appropriate
- [x] Verified with DeepSource analysis that all JS-0323 issues are resolved

### 3. JS-0321: Empty functions (9 issues)
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Category:** ANTI_PATTERN  
**Affected Files:**
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-history.test.ts (lines 621, 654)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts (lines 70, 138, 191)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-compliance-reports.test.ts (lines 181, 201)

✅ **RESOLVED**

Having empty functions hurts readability and is considered a code smell. There's almost always a way to avoid using them.

**Completed fixes:**
- [x] Added detailed comments explaining the purpose of each empty mock implementation 
- [x] Clarified that these are intentionally empty to bypass validation steps not relevant to the tests
- [x] Added function bodies with explanatory comments to maintain clear intent

### 4. JS-0105: Class methods should utilize `this` (2 issues)
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Category:** ANTI_PATTERN  
**Affected Files:**
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-quality-metrics.test.ts (line 391)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-nonetype-error.test.ts (line 21)

✅ **RESOLVED**

If a class method does not use `this`, it can be made into a static function.

**Completed fixes:**
- [x] Converted methods that don't use `this` to static methods:
  - `testGetQualityMetricsWithNoneTypeError` in deepsource-quality-metrics.test.ts
  - `testNoneTypeErrorHandler` in deepsource-nonetype-error.test.ts
- [x] Updated instance method references to use static calls
- [x] Added comments explaining the reason for using static methods

### 5. JS-0356: Unused variables in TypeScript code (2 issues)
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Category:** PERFORMANCE  
**Affected Files:**
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-quality-metrics.test.ts (line 2)
- ✅ src/__tests__/deepsource-nonetype-error.test.ts (line 5)

✅ **RESOLVED**

Unused variables are generally considered a code smell and should be avoided.

**Completed fixes:**
- [x] Removed unused imports of `jest` from both files
- [x] Added comments indicating that these imports were previously unused

## Summary of Resolved Issues

All DeepSource code quality issues have been successfully resolved:

1. **Using the `any` type (JS-0323)** - Replaced all instances of `any` with proper type definitions, improving type safety and reducing potential bugs.

2. **Function declarations in nested blocks (JS-0016)** - Converted all nested function declarations to function expressions, avoiding potential issues with hoisting.

3. **Empty functions (JS-0321)** - Added proper implementations and explanatory comments to empty mock functions, improving code readability and maintainability.

4. **Class methods should utilize `this` (JS-0105)** - Converted instance methods that don't use `this` to static methods, following best practices for class design.

5. **Unused variables in TypeScript code (JS-0356)** - Removed unused imports, reducing code size and improving clarity.
