## Completed Fixes

### File: src/__tests__/deepsource-error-handling-comprehensive.test.ts

All 8 instances of `any` type usage have been fixed by replacing them with `Record<string, unknown>`:

1. **Line 124**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`  
2. **Line 135**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
3. **Line 152**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
4. **Line 169**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
5. **Line 186**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
6. **Line 208**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
7. **Line 230**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`
8. **Line 256**: ✅ FIXED - Replaced `any` with `Record<string, unknown>`

## Implementation Approach Used

The approach used to fix these issues was as follows:

1. Examined each occurrence of the `any` type in the code
2. Determined the actual structure of the data being handled
3. Replaced with `Record<string, unknown>` where appropriate
4. Ran tests to ensure the fixes did not break existing functionality
5. Committed changes incrementally

## All Fixed Issues Summary

### Fixed `any` Type Issues (22 total)

1. Replaced occurrences of `any` with `Record<string, unknown>` for better type safety
2. Added explicit type assertions to improve type checking
3. Used proper interface definitions where appropriate

### Fixed Empty Functions (6 total)

1. Added comments to explain why functions are empty (suppressing console output during tests)
2. Made the suppression purpose explicit to future developers

### Fixed Complex Boolean Returns (2 total)

1. Simplified if-return true/false patterns to direct condition returns
2. Used logical negation to maintain readability where appropriate

### Fixed Shorthand Type Coercions (2 total)

1. Replaced shorthand coercions with explicit conversions (e.g., `!!x` → `Boolean(x)`)
2. Made code intention clearer and improved readability

## Next Steps

With all DeepSource issues now resolved, the following steps can be considered:

1. Merge the current branch into main
2. Consider integrating the comprehensive test files into the automated test suite:
   - Fix mocking issues for network interactions
   - Set up proper GraphQL response fixtures
   - Update expectations to match actual behavior
   - Remove `.skip` annotations once tests are stable

The code is now free of DeepSource-detected quality issues and provides stronger type safety throughout the codebase.
