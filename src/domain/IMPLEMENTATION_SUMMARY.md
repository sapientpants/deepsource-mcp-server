# Domain Layer Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation completes section 2.1 "Domain Aggregate Design" from the refactoring plan. The following components have been successfully created:

### 1. Base Domain Building Blocks

#### Shared Infrastructure (`src/domain/shared/`)
- **ValueObject**: Base class for immutable value objects with equality comparison
- **Entity**: Base class for entities with unique identity
- **AggregateRoot**: Base class for aggregate roots with domain event support
- **Repository Interface**: Base repository pattern with pagination support

### 2. Value Objects (`src/domain/value-objects/`)

#### ThresholdValue
- Represents metric thresholds with validation
- Enforces min/max allowed ranges
- Provides percentage threshold factory method
- Includes `isMet()` method for threshold evaluation

#### MetricValue
- Encapsulates metric measurements with units
- Supports custom display formatting
- Tracks measurement timestamps
- Provides percentage change calculations

#### IssueCount
- Non-negative integer count validation
- Optional category support
- Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, increment, decrement)
- Zero and positive checks

#### CoveragePercentage
- Specialized value object for coverage metrics (0-100%)
- Coverage level categorization (excellent/good/fair/poor)
- Weighted average combination
- Fraction to percentage conversion

### 3. Domain Aggregates

#### Project Aggregate (`src/domain/aggregates/project/`)
- **Aggregate Root**: Project with ProjectKey identity
- **Child Entities**: ProjectRepository (VCS info), ProjectConfiguration
- **Status Management**: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, ARCHIVED states
- **Business Methods**: 
  - `activate()` / `deactivate()` / `archive()`
  - `updateConfiguration()`
  - `canRunAnalysis()`
- **Domain Events**: ProjectCreated, ProjectActivated, ProjectDeactivated, ProjectArchived, ProjectUpdated
- **Repository Interface**: IProjectRepository with project-specific queries

#### AnalysisRun Aggregate (`src/domain/aggregates/analysis-run/`)
- **Aggregate Root**: AnalysisRun with RunId identity
- **Child Entities**: IssueOccurrence collection, RunSummary
- **Status Transitions**: PENDING → RUNNING → SUCCESS/FAILURE/TIMEOUT/CANCELLED
- **Business Methods**:
  - `start()` / `complete()` / `fail()` / `timeout()` / `cancel()` / `skip()`
  - `addIssue()` / `removeIssue()`
  - Automatic summary calculation
- **Domain Events**: AnalysisRunCreated, AnalysisRunStarted, AnalysisRunCompleted, etc.
- **Repository Interface**: IAnalysisRunRepository with run-specific queries

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

- All aggregates use branded types from the existing type system
- Repository interfaces are strongly typed with proper generics
- Domain events follow a consistent structure
- Value objects provide compile-time type safety

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Immutability**: All value objects are immutable with factory methods for updates
2. **Domain Events**: Aggregates emit events for all state changes
3. **Repository Pattern**: Clear separation between domain logic and persistence
4. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of TypeScript's type system and branded types
5. **Validation**: Business rules enforced at construction time

## Integration Points

The domain layer is designed to integrate with the existing codebase:
- Uses existing branded types from `src/types/branded.ts`
- Compatible with existing models in `src/models/`
- Can be used by handlers in `src/handlers/`
- Repository implementations can use the existing DeepSourceClient

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Remaining Aggregates**:
   - QualityMetrics aggregate
   - ComplianceReport aggregate

2. **Create Repository Implementations**:
   - Concrete implementations using DeepSourceClient
   - In-memory implementations for testing

3. **Update Handlers**:
   - Refactor handlers to use domain aggregates
   - Create mappers between domain models and API responses

4. **Add Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Unit tests for all domain components
   - Integration tests for repository implementations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Domain Boundaries**: Each aggregate encapsulates its own business logic
2. **Type Safety**: Enhanced with value objects and branded types
3. **Testability**: Domain logic separated from infrastructure
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns following DDD principles
5. **Business Rule Enforcement**: Invariants ensure data consistency
