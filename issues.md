## Maintaining Code Quality

To maintain high code quality and prevent new issues, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Always write comprehensive tests for new code
   - Ensure all lines, branches, and methods are tested
   - Run `pnpm run test:coverage` to verify test coverage

2. **Code Style**:
   - Use regular strings instead of template literals when no interpolation is needed
   - Use `const` for variables that are never reassigned
   - Use proper TypeScript types instead of `any`
   - Follow the ESLint rules configured for the project

3. **Pre-Commit Checks**:
   - Run `pnpm run ci` before committing to check:
     - Code formatting (`format:check`)
     - Linting (`lint`)
     - Type checking (`check-types`)
     - Building (`build`)
     - Tests (`test:coverage`)

4. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Ensure all tests pass in the CI pipeline
   - Address any DeepSource issues flagged in new pull requests
