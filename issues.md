# DeepSource Issues

## Type Safety Issues

### JS-0323: Detected usage of the `any` type (CRITICAL)

The `any` type creates a potential safety hole and source of bugs. Replace with `unknown` or `never` type.

1. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:59**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace `any` type with a more specific type~~
   - ~~TypeScript skips type checking for `any` typed variables~~
   - ~~Use `unknown` or `never` instead~~
   - ✅ Fixed by using `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any`

2. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:4**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace `any` type with a more specific type~~
   - ~~TypeScript skips type checking for `any` typed variables~~
   - ~~Use `unknown` or `never` instead~~
   - ✅ Fixed by creating a specific `MetricHistoryValue` interface

### JS-0296: Use of a banned type detected (MAJOR)

Replace banned types with safer alternatives for better type safety.

1. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts:196**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type (`Object`, `Function`, etc.) with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Uppercase primitive types should be replaced with lowercase versions~~
   - ~~Use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `Object` or `{}`~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(reportType: ReportType) => string`

2. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts:146**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Use specific function signatures instead of the `Function` type~~
   - ~~Use proper object types with defined structures~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(reportType: ReportType) => string`

3. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts:11**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Possibly using an uppercase primitive type or general object type~~
   - ~~Use more specific typing to enhance type safety~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(response: unknown, reportType: ReportType) => Record<string, unknown> | null`

4. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts:108**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Possibly using `Object` or `{}` which mean "any non-nullish value"~~
   - ~~Use more specific typing like `Record<string, unknown>`~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature

5. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts:76**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~May be using `Function` which provides little type safety~~
   - ~~Use proper function type signatures instead~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(error: unknown) => boolean`

6. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts:56**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Review type definitions and use specific interfaces or types~~
   - ~~Use lowercase primitive types for consistency~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(provider: string) => string`

7. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts:8**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~May be using upper-case primitive types~~
   - ~~Use specific type structures instead of general object types~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature `(project: Record<string, unknown>, projectKey: string) => void`

8. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts:267**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Use proper type signatures that define expected structure~~
   - ~~Consider using branded types for better type safety~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with specific function signature for `calculateTrendDirection`

9. ~~**src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts:8**~~ (FIXED)
   - ~~Replace banned type with safer alternatives~~
   - ~~Replace with proper type definitions for better code clarity~~
   - ~~Follow TypeScript best practices for type definitions~~
   - ✅ Fixed by replacing `Function` with a detailed type signature for `processHistoricalData`
