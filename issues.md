## Summary

This shows the latest DeepSource analysis results. We've successfully resolved 12 issues since the last run. The 4 "new" issues appear to be false positives or a sync issue with DeepSource, as our code shows the fixes are already applied.

---

## Potential False Positives (Need Verification)

### 1. Detected usage of the `any` type (JS-0323)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** ANTI_PATTERN  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE

**Reported Locations:**
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:59`
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-metrics-response.test.ts:4`

**VERIFIED:** These lines do NOT contain `any` types in the current code. Line 4 has a proper typed function parameter, and line 59 is just a `beforeAll(() => {` statement. These appear to be false positives or DeepSource analyzing cached/old data.

---

### 2. Found warning comments in code (JS-0099)
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Category:** DOCUMENTATION  
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE

**Reported Location:**
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-threshold-updates.test.ts:29`

**VERIFIED:** This line is past the end of the file (file only has 28 lines). The TODO comment was previously removed. This appears to be a false positive.

---

### 3. Use of a banned type detected (JS-0296)
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Category:** ANTI_PATTERN  
**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Reported Locations:**
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-report-utils.test.ts` - multiple lines
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts` - multiple lines  
- `src/__tests__/deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts` - multiple lines

**NOTE:** These were previously fixed to use specific function signatures instead of `Function` type. Need to verify if these are false positives.

---

## Actual Issues

### 4. Lines not covered in tests (TCV-001)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** COVERAGE  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**NOTE:** Line 2691 is covered by our new test

**TODO:** Add comprehensive test coverage for all these lines. This is the main legitimate issue that needs to be addressed.

## Summary of Action Items

1. **Report False Positives**: The `any` type and TODO comment issues appear to be false positives, as the code shows these are already fixed
2. **Verify Banned Types**: Check if the Function type issues are also false positives
3. **Add Test Coverage**: This is the primary real issue - add tests for 52 uncovered lines in `src/deepsource.ts`
4. **Sync with DeepSource**: May need to trigger a rescan or clear cache in DeepSource to get accurate results

Total Actual Issues: 52 test coverage issues (the other issues appear to be false positives or sync issues)
