## Test Coverage Issues - TCV-001

### Issue Description
A source line is considered covered when at least one instruction that is assigned to this line has been executed by a test case. These lines were not executed during any of the test cases.

### Detailed Todo List

#### File: `src/deepsource.ts`

## Action Plan

### 1. Analyze uncovered lines
- Review each uncovered line to understand what functionality needs testing
- Identify logical groups of related functionality that can be tested together

### 2. Create test cases
- Write test cases that exercise each uncovered line
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure paths
- Pay special attention to edge cases and error conditions

### 3. Priority order
- Start with the most critical functionality (auth, error handling, core business logic)
- Then move to utility functions and edge cases

### Test Categories to Focus On
Based on the line numbers, these appear to be gaps in:
- Error handling and edge cases
- Specific method branches that weren't exercised
- Fallback/default behaviors
- Exception catches

### Notes
- All issues are in the same file: `src/deepsource.ts`
- These are all test coverage issues (no code quality issues)
- Achieving 100% coverage will require comprehensive test cases
- Some lines might be defensive code or error handlers that are difficult to trigger naturally

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Review all 49 uncovered lines
- [x] Group related functionality
- [x] Write test plan for each group
- [x] Implement test cases (34/49 completed)
- [ ] Verify coverage improvement
