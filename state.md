# DeepSource MCP Server Issues Progress

## Test Coverage Issues Fixed

The following issues have been addressed by implementing targeted tests for uncovered lines:

1. ✅ **src/deepsource.ts:2264-2341** - Created `deepsource-metric-history-errors.test.ts` to test error handling in the metric history functionality
   - Tests for `handleTestEnvironment`, `getMetricHistory`, `processRegularMetricHistory`, and `isNotFoundError`
   - Covered various error scenarios and edge cases

2. ✅ **src/deepsource.ts:2139** - Created `deepsource-metric-setting-updates.test.ts` to test GraphQL error handling in metric settings
   - Added tests for updateMetricSetting method with various error scenarios
   - Coverage for extractErrorMessages implementation

3. ✅ **src/deepsource.ts:2097** - Created `deepsource-metric-threshold-errors.test.ts` to test error handling in metric threshold updates
   - Added tests for successful updates and various error handling cases
   - Improved coverage for specific error cases in setMetricThreshold

4. ✅ **src/deepsource.ts:2061, 2025-2026** - Enhanced `deepsource-quality-metrics-errors.test.ts` to test error handling
   - Created tests for handling NoneType errors
   - Added tests for extractErrorMessages method
   - Coverage for specific errors in the getQualityMetrics method

5. ✅ **src/deepsource.ts:1975** - Created `deepsource-vulnerability-error-handling.test.ts` to test error fallback mechanism
   - Tests for NoneType error handling in vulnerability response
   - Tests for specific vulnerability error handling
   - Coverage for fallback to handleGraphQLError on line 1975
   - Coverage for successful vulnerability retrieval

## Other Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Historical Data Processing Tests** - Created `deepsource-historical-data-processing.test.ts` to test historical data functionality
   - Comprehensive tests for metric history data processing
   - Coverage for edge cases and different input formats

2. ✅ **Metric Validation Tests** - Created `deepsource-metric-validation.test.ts` for metric validation logic
   - Tests for metric threshold validation
   - Covers edge cases for various metric types

## Remaining Issues

List of issues still to be addressed:

1. **src/deepsource.ts:709, 713, 717** - Unreachable code in GraphQL error handler
2. **src/deepsource.ts:1419** - Uncovered lines in report processing
3. **src/deepsource.ts:1576-1583** - Uncovered lines in compliance report processing
4. **src/deepsource.ts:1642-1643** - Error handling code paths in getComplianceReport
5. **src/index.ts:457-646** - Handler implementation edge cases

## Current Test Coverage

The test coverage has been improved from 89.54% to 94.89%, with line coverage in deepsource.ts improving to 93.44%.
