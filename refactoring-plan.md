## Progress Tracker

### âœ… Completed
- Base handler infrastructure (handler.interface.ts, handler.factory.ts)
- Tool registry system (tool-registry.ts)
- Centralized tool definitions (tool-definitions.ts)
- Quality metrics handler refactoring
- Compliance reports handler refactoring

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Handler refactoring for remaining handlers

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- MCP server extraction
- Domain modeling improvements
- Client architecture redesign

- Testing infrastructure improvements

## 1. Handler Architecture Refactoring

### Current Issues:
- ~~Inconsistent handler patterns (some use dependency injection, others don't)~~ âœ… Partially resolved
- ~~Direct environment variable access in handlers~~ âœ… Partially resolved
- Mixed responsibilities between MCP tool registration and business logic
- ~~Repetitive error handling and response formatting~~ âœ… Partially resolved

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 1.1 Standardize Handler Pattern âœ… In Progress
- ~~Create a unified handler factory pattern for all handlers~~ âœ… Done
- Move all business logic out of the main index.ts file
- ~~Implement consistent dependency injection across all handlers~~ âœ… Partially done

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `BaseHandlerDeps` interface for common dependencies
- Implemented `createBaseHandlerFactory` for consistent handler creation
- Added `HandlerFunction` and `HandlerFactory` types for type safety
- Handlers now receive dependencies via factory pattern instead of direct env access

**Remaining Handlers to Refactor:**
- [ ] project-issues.ts
- [ ] project-runs.ts
- [ ] run.ts
- [ ] recent-run-issues.ts
- [ ] dependency-vulnerabilities.ts

#### 1.2 Handler Middleware System âœ… Partially Implemented
- ~~Implement a middleware pipeline for cross-cutting concerns:~~ âœ… Basic implementation done
  - ~~Request validation~~ âœ… Via Zod in ToolRegistry
  - ~~Error handling and classification~~ âœ… In createBaseHandlerFactory
  - ~~Response formatting~~ âœ… Via wrapInApiResponse
  - ~~Logging and metrics~~ âœ… In createBaseHandlerFactory

**Implementation Details:**
- Error handling centralized in `createBaseHandlerFactory`
- Logging automatically captures handler invocation, success, and errors
- Response formatting handled by `wrapInApiResponse` helper

#### 1.3 Tool Registration Abstraction âœ… Done
- ~~Create a ToolRegistry class to manage tool definitions~~ âœ… Done
- ~~Separate tool schema definitions from handler logic~~ âœ… Done
- ~~Implement automatic tool discovery and registration~~ âœ… Done

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `ToolRegistry` class with type-safe tool registration
- Tool definitions centralized in `tool-definitions.ts`
- Registry handles MCP server registration, validation, and response formatting
- Supports both Zod input/output validation and automatic error handling

## 2. Domain Modeling Improvements

### Current Issues:
- Loose domain boundaries between different concerns
- Missing aggregate roots for complex entities
- Insufficient use of branded types throughout the codebase

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 2.1 Domain Aggregate Design
- Create proper aggregates for:
  - Project (root: includes issues, runs, metrics)
  - AnalysisRun (root: includes issues, summaries)
  - QualityMetrics (root: includes thresholds, history)
  - ComplianceReport (root: includes stats, trends)

#### 2.2 Repository Pattern Implementation
- Create repository interfaces for each aggregate
- Implement caching strategies at the repository level
- Separate read and write operations (CQRS-lite)

#### 2.3 Enhanced Type Safety
- Extend branded types usage to all identifiers
- Create value objects for complex values (e.g., ThresholdValue, MetricValue)
- Implement discriminated unions for all status/state fields

## 3. Client Architecture Redesign

### Current Issues:
- Monolithic DeepSourceClient with too many responsibilities
- Missing abstraction layers between GraphQL and domain logic
- Inconsistent error handling across client methods

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 3.1 Client Modularization
- Split DeepSourceClient into domain-specific clients:
  - ProjectsClient (already exists)
  - IssuesClient
  - RunsClient
  - MetricsClient
  - ComplianceClient
  - VulnerabilityClient

#### 3.2 GraphQL Query Builder
- Create a fluent query builder for GraphQL operations
- Implement query composition and fragment reuse
- Add query result caching with proper invalidation

#### 3.3 Connection Management
- Implement proper HTTP client configuration
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures

## 4. Error Handling Enhancement

### Current Issues:
- Inconsistent error classification and handling
- Missing MCP-specific error codes
- Poor error context propagation

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 4.1 MCP Error Standardization
- Map all errors to proper MCP error codes
- Implement error context preservation
- Create error recovery strategies for transient failures

#### 4.2 Error Middleware
- Centralize error handling in middleware
- Add user-friendly error messages with actionable steps
- Implement proper error logging and categorization

## 5. Testing Infrastructure

### Current Issues:
- Test coverage gaps in error scenarios
- Missing integration tests for MCP protocol
- Insufficient mock infrastructure

### Proposed Improvements:

#### 5.1 Test Harness Enhancement
- Create MCP protocol test harness
- Add contract testing for GraphQL queries
- Implement scenario-based testing for error cases

#### 5.2 Mock Infrastructure
- Create comprehensive mock servers
- Implement fixture-based testing
- Add test utilities for common scenarios

## Implementation Priority (Updated)

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Foundation âœ… Partially Complete
- ~~Standardize handler patterns~~ âœ… Done for 2 handlers, 5 remaining
- ~~Implement basic middleware system~~ âœ… Done via factory pattern
- ~~Create core domain models~~ ðŸ“‹ Pending

**Actual Progress:** 
- Days 1-2: Created base infrastructure and refactored 2 handlers
- Discovered that factory pattern provides sufficient middleware functionality
- Tool registry implementation was more complex than anticipated due to MCP type requirements

### Phase 2 (Week 2): Client & Repository Layer
- Complete remaining handler refactoring (Days 3-4)
- Split monolithic client into domain-specific clients (Days 5-6)
- Implement repository interfaces (Day 7)
- Add GraphQL query builder (Days 8-9)

### Phase 3 (Week 3): Error Handling & Testing
- Enhance error handling with MCP standards
- Implement comprehensive test harness
- Add integration tests
- Increase test coverage for new components

### Phase 4 (Week 4): Refinement
- Complete tool registration abstraction
- Add remaining domain aggregates
- Enhance type safety throughout
- Documentation and final cleanup

## Success Metrics

- Clear separation of concerns with defined domain boundaries
- 90%+ test coverage across all modules
- Consistent error handling with proper MCP error codes
- Modular, maintainable codebase following SOLID principles
- Improved developer experience with clear abstractions

## Lessons Learned (So Far)

### What Worked Well
1. **Factory Pattern**: The `createBaseHandlerFactory` provided an elegant solution for:
   - Consistent error handling
   - Automatic logging
   - Dependency injection
   - Response formatting

2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with `HandlerFunction` and `HandlerFactory` types caught issues early

3. **Centralized Tool Definitions**: Having all Zod schemas in one place improves maintainability

### Challenges Encountered
1. **MCP Type Compatibility**: The MCP server has specific type requirements that needed careful handling:
   - Required `Record<string, unknown>` for handler parameters
   - Response format must include `content` array
   - Had to create custom `McpResponse` type for proper typing

2. **ESLint Configuration**: Some patterns (like factory functions) triggered unused variable warnings that needed suppression

3. **Test Coverage**: New infrastructure components (tool-registry, tool-definitions) need comprehensive tests

### Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Handler Refactoring**: Use the established pattern consistently:
   ```typescript
   export const createXHandler = createBaseHandlerFactory('handler_name', async (deps, params) => {
     // Implementation
   });
   ```

2. **Test First**: Write tests for new components before implementation

3. **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each handler refactoring to maintain a clean history

4. **Type Assertions**: Be careful with type assertions - prefer proper typing over `as unknown as Type`

## Quick Reference for Continuing the Refactoring

### Handler Refactoring Template
```typescript
// 1. Import dependencies
import { BaseHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.interface.js';
import { createBaseHandlerFactory, wrapInApiResponse, createDefaultHandlerDeps } from './base/handler.factory.js';
import { createLogger } from '../utils/logging/logger.js';

// 2. Create logger
const logger = createLogger('HandlerName');

// 3. Create handler with factory
export const createHandlerName = createBaseHandlerFactory(
  'tool_name',
  async (deps, params: ParamsType) => {
    const apiKey = deps.getApiKey();
    const client = new DeepSourceClient(apiKey);
    
    // Handler logic here
    const result = await client.someMethod(params);
    
    // Format response
    return wrapInApiResponse(result);
  }
);

// 4. Export public function
export async function handleHandlerName(params: ParamsType) {
  const deps = createDefaultHandlerDeps({ logger });
  const handler = createHandlerName(deps);
  return handler(params);
}
```
